In the big data time, servitization becomes one of the important#development trends-of the IT world.
More and more software resources are developed and existed in the format of services in Internet.
These services from multi-domains and multi-networks are converged as a huge complicated service network or ecosystem, which can be called as Big Service.
How  resource to rapidly develop the new applications or software services 
to meet massive individualized customer requirements is a key issue in the big data and big service ecosystem. 
Based on analyzing the ecosystem of big service, this paper presents a new paradigm of software service engineering, 
RE2SEP (Requirement-Engineering Two-Phase of Service Engineering Paradigm ), which includes service oriented requirement engineering, 
domain oriented service engineering, and the development approach of software services. By means of the RE2SEP approach, 
the adaptive service solutions can be efficiently designed and implemented to match the requirement propositions of massive individualized customers in Big Service ecosystem.
A case study of the RE2SEP applications, which is a project on citizen¡¯s mobility service in mart city environment, is also given in this paper. 
The RE2SEP paradigm will change the way of traditional life-cycle oriented software engineering, and lead a new approach of software service engineering.
